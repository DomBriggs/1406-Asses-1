<h1>CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan - CossiePlay</h1>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> Dominic Briggs<br>
  <strong>Login:</strong> jc321451</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>The goal of this website is to increase the revenue of CossiePlay, a custom costume business by establishing a web presence and encouraging sales.</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>Success can be easily measured by comparing revenue generated before and after the website is implemented, and monitoring the amount of registers through the website.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>The target audience is high-schoolers and young adults. This demographic will be reached by making the site simple and efficient, with a "to-the-point" design philosophy. This is because young people do not care for the 'splendour of the internet' and features that might impress a younger or older age range, as they are well versed with the internet. Additionally, the shortened attention span of millenials means getting them to the point as soon as possible is vital, as opposed to an older demographic that would be content browsing the site for as much information as possible.</p>
